# PCA_and_Gaussian_Kernel_PCA_for_Image_Classification
This project investigates the application of PCA and Gaussian kernel PCA for image feature extraction and classification. Inspired by Quan Wang's research, it compares error rates using a linear classifier and includes functions for data processing, PCA/kPCA computation, and evaluation.
